## Introduction

- In the last class, we covered model assessment and validation.

--

- Today, we will move on to controlling for and interpreting special predictors in regression models.

--

- Specifically, we will talk about higher order terms, indicator/dummy variables and interaction terms. 

--

- We have already had some introduction to the first two, so we will simply formalize the concepts.

--

- This is lead us to start to talk about model selection.

--

- In the next class, we will dive properly into model building, selection and comparison for MLR models.

# Special predictors



---
## Special predictors: higher order terms

- From the Harris Trust and Savings Bank example, we have already seen that the relationships between a response variable and some of the predictors can be potentially nonlinear. 

--

- Sometimes our outcome of interest can appear to have quadratic or even higher order polynomial trends with some predictors.

--

- Whenever this is the case, we should look to include squared terms or higher order powers for predictors to capture trends.

--

- In that particular example, we included squared terms for both age and experience.

--

- .block[General practice: include all lower order terms when including higher order ones (even if the lower order terms are not significant). This aids interpretation.
]

--

- As we have seen before, the best way to present results when including quadratic/polynomial trends is to plot the predicted average of $Y$ for different values of $X$.



---
## Special predictors: indicator/dummy variables

- From the Harris Trust and Savings Bank example, we have also seen how to include binary variables in a MLR model with the variable `sex`.

--

- In the example, we could actually have used the variable `fsex` (where 1=female and 0=male) instead of `sex` to give us the same exact results.

--

- That means that we also could have made a variable equal to one for all males and zero for all females, instead.

--

- The value of that coefficient would be $767$ instead of $-767$ like we had. All other statistics stay the same (SE, t-stat, p-value). Other coefficients also remain the same.

--

- Turns out that we cannot include indicator variables for the two values of the same binary variable when we also include the intercept.



---
## Special predictors: indicator/dummy variables

- It is not possible to estimate all three of these parameters in the same model uniquely.

--

- The exact same problem arises for any set of predictors such that one is an exact linear combination of the others.

--

- Example: Consider a regression model with dummy variables for both males and females, plus an intercept.
.block[
.small[
$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \textrm{M}_i + \beta_2 \textrm{F}_i + \epsilon_i = \beta_0*1 + \beta_1 \textrm{M}_i + \beta_2 \textrm{F}_i + \epsilon_i$$
]
]

--

- Note that $\textrm{M}_i + \textrm{F}_i = 1$ for all cases. Thus,
.block[
.small[
$$y_i = \beta_0*(\textrm{M}_i + \textrm{F}_i) + \beta_1 \textrm{M}_i + \beta_2 \textrm{F}_i + \epsilon_i = (\beta_0+\beta_1) \textrm{M}_i + (\beta_0+\beta_2) \textrm{F}_i + \epsilon_i.$$
]
]

  We can estimate $(\beta_0+\beta_1)$ and $(\beta_0+\beta_2)$ but not all three uniquely.

--

- .block[Side note: there is no need to mean center dummy variables, since they have a natural interpretation at zero.]



---
## Special predictors: indicator/dummy variables

- What if a categorical variable has $k > 2$ levels?

--

- Make $k$ dummy variables, one for each level. 

--

- Use only $k-1$ of the levels in the regression model, since we cannot uniquely estimate all $k$ at once if we also include an intercept (see previous slide).

--

- Excluded level is called the baseline.

--

- R will actually do this for you automatically; that is, make the $k-1$ dummy variables and set the first level as the baseline.

--

- Values of coefficients of dummy variables are interpreted as changes in average $Y$ over the baseline.

--

- We will go through an in-class example today.



---
## Special predictors: interaction terms

- Sometimes relationship of some predictor with $Y$ depends on values of other predictors. This is called an .hlight[interaction effect].

--

- Sometimes, the question we wish to answer would require including interactions in the model, even though they might not be significant.

--

- An example of interaction effect for the Harris Bank dataset would be if the effect of age on baseline income was different for male versus female.

--

- That is, what if older males are paid more starting salaries than younger males but the reverse is actually the case for females?

--

- How do we account for such interaction effects? Make an interaction predictor: multiply one predictor times the other predictor.

--

- .block[General practice is to include all main effects (each variable without interaction) when including interactions.]



---
## Testing if groups of coefficients are equal to zero

- With so many variables (polynomial terms, dummy variables and interactions) in a linear model, we may want to test if multiple coefficients are equal to zero or not.

--

- We can do so using an F test (a nested F test in this case).

--

- First, we fit a MLR model with all $p$ predictors. That is,
.block[
.small[
$$\textrm{M}_1: \  y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i1} + \beta_2 x_{i2} + \ldots + \beta_p x_{ip} + \epsilon_i; \ \ \epsilon_i \overset{iid}{\sim} N(0, \sigma^2).$$
]
]

--

- We can compute the sum of squares of the errors $(\textrm{SSE}_1)$ or residual sum of squares $(\textrm{RSS}_1)$ for the FULL model, that is,
.block[
.small[
$$\textrm{RSS}_1 = \sum^n_{i=1} \left(y_i - \hat{y}_i \right)^2.$$
]
]


---
## Testing if groups of coefficients are equal to zero

- Now suppose we want to test that a particular subset of $q$ of the coefficients are zero.
.block[
.small[
$$H_0: \beta_{p-q+1} = \beta_{p-q+2} = \ldots = \beta_p = 0.$$
]
]

--

- We fit a reduced model that uses all the variables except the last $q$, that is,
.block[
.small[
$$\textrm{M}_{0}: \ y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i1} + \beta_2 x_{i2} + \ldots + \beta_p x_{i(p-q)} + \epsilon_i; \ \ \epsilon_i \overset{iid}{\sim} N(0, \sigma^2).$$
]
]

--

- Let's call the residual sum of squares for that model $\textrm{RSS}_0$.

--

--
<div class="question">
Which of the two RSS values would be larger? Why?
</div>

--

- Then the appropriate F-statistic is
.block[
.small[
$$F = \dfrac{(\textrm{RSS}_0 - \textrm{RSS}_1)/q}{\textrm{RSS}_1/(n-p-1)}.$$
]
]


---
## Testing if groups of coefficients are equal to zero

- To calculate the p-value, look for the area under the $F$ curve with $q$ degrees of freedom in the numerator, and $(n-p-1)$ degrees of freedom in the denominator.

--

- Guess what? As is the case with pretty much everything else we do in this class, this is so easy to do in R!

--

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height="300px"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/surprised-baby.jpeg")
```


---
## The problem of multicollinearity

- Just like we had with the dummy variables, you cannot include two variables with a perfect linear association as predictors in regression.

--

- Example: suppose the true population line is
.block[
.small[
$$\textrm{Avg. y} = 3 + 4x.$$
]
]

--

- Suppose we try to include $x$ and $z = x/10$ as predictors in our own model,
- Example: suppose the true population line is
.block[
.small[
$$\textrm{Avg. y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \beta_2 z,$$
]
]

  and estimate all coefficients. Since $z = x/10$, we have
.block[
.small[
$$\textrm{Avg. y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \beta_2 \dfrac{x}{10} = \beta_0 + \left( \beta_1 +  \dfrac{\beta_2}{10} \right) x$$
]
]

--

- We could set $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ to ANY two numbers such that $\beta_1 +  \beta_2/10 = 4$. The data cannot pick from the possible combinations.



---
## The problem of multicollinearity

- In real data, when we get “close” to perfect colinearities we see standard errors inflate, sometimes massively.

--

- When might we get close:
  + Very high correlations $(|\rho| > 0.9)$ among two (or more) predictors in modest sample sizes.
  + When one or more variables are nearly a linear combination of the others.
  + Including quadratic terms as predictors without first mean centering the values before squaring.
  + Including interactions involving continuous variables.
  
  
---
## The problem of multicollinearity

- How to diagnose:
  + Look at a correlation matrix of all the predictors (including dummy variables). Look for values near -1 or 1.
  + If you are suspicious that some predictor is a near linear combination of others, run a regression of that predictor on all other predictors (not including Y) to see if R squared is near 1.
  + If the R squared is near 1, you should think about centering your variables or maybe even excluding that variable from your regression in some cases.
  + Take a look at the .hlight[variance inflation factor]. 
  + Variance inflation factor measures how much the multicollinearity between a variable and other variables in the model inflates the variance of the regression coefficient for that variable.
  
  
---
## Variance inflation factor

- .block[
.small[
$$\textrm{VIF}_j = \dfrac{1}{1-R^2_{X_j | X_{-j}}}$$
]
]

  where $R^2_{X_j | X_{-j}}$ is the R-squared from the regression of predictor $X_j$ on all other predictors $(X_1, \ldots,X_{j-1},X_{j+1},\ldots, X_{p})$.
  
--

- Since R-squared always lies between 0 and 1, 
  + the denominator $1-R^2_{X_j | X_{-j}} \leq 1$ 
  + which implies that $\textrm{VIF} \geq 1$

--

- Generally, VIF of 
  + 1 = not correlated. Why?
  + between 1 and 5 = moderately correlated.
  + greater than 5 = highly correlated.
  
  
---
## We see multicollinearity... so what?

- Multicollinearity is really only a problem if standard errors for the involved coefficients are too large to be useful for interpretation, and you actually care about interpreting those coefficients.

--

- In the Harris Bank example,
  + The main coefficient of interest is the one for `sex`.
  + The remaining variables are really just "control variables". That is, those variables may be correlated with both `bsal` and `sex`, and so we want to account for their effects in our model.
  + Recall that the correlation between `age` and `exper` was actually 0.8.
  + Even with this correlation, it is still okay to keep both in the model since we want to simply account for them but do not care about interpreting either.
  
- Another scenario is prediction: including highly correlated predictors can increase prediction uncertainty.


---
## What to do about multicollinearity?

- What if you do want to interpret the coefficients involved in the multicollinearity, and the SEs are inflated substantially because of it?

- Easiest remedy: remove one of the "offending" predictors.

- Keep the one that is easiest to explain or that has the largest T-statistic.

--

- Better remedy: 
  + Explore shrinkage methods, for example lasso and ridge regressions, to shrink the coefficients of some of the variables towards zero.
  + Use a Bayesian regression model with an informative prior distribution on the parameters (take STA602!).
  + Get more data! Multicollinearity tends to be unimportant in large sample sizes.



---
## Example: multiple regression of diamonds data

- A diamond's value is often determined using four factors known as the 4Cs: color, clarity, cut (certification) and carat weight.
  + Color: evaluation based on absence of color; how pure the diamond is. 
  + Clarity: evaluation based on absence of blemishes.
  + Certification: how well the diamond is cut; how well a diamond's facets interacts with light.
  + Carat weight: measures how much the diamond weighs.
  
- We will use some data to draw inference about how these factors affect a diamond's price

- The data is in the file `diamonds.csv` on Sakai.

- You can read more about the 4Cs [here](https://4cs.gia.edu/en-us/4cs-diamond-quality/).


---
## Multiple regression of diamonds data
```{r}
diamonds <- read.csv("data/diamonds.csv", header= T,
                     colClasses = c("numeric","factor","factor","factor","numeric"))
dim(diamonds)
head(diamonds)
summary(diamonds)
```


---
## Multiple regression of diamonds data

Let's do exploratory data analysis. First, the distribution of `price`.
```{r fig.height=3.4}
hist(diamonds$Price,xlab="Price",main="Distribution of price",col=rainbow(10))
```

--
<div class="question">
Is this distribution normal?
</div>


---
## Multiple regression of diamonds data

Next, explore the relationship between `price` and `carats`
```{r fig.height=3.4}
plot(diamonds$Price~diamonds$Carats,xlab="Carats",ylab="Price",col='cyan4')
abline(lm(Price~Carats,data=diamonds),col='red3',lty=10,lwd=2)
```

--
<div class="question">
What do you think of this plot?
</div>


---
## Multiple regression of diamonds data

Since the distribution of `carats` is not really normal, let's transform the variable. This is the natural log, you can try other bases on your own.
```{r fig.height=3.4}
hist(log(diamonds$Price),xlab="Log Price",main="Distribution of log price",col=rainbow(10))
```

--
<div class="question">
Is this distribution normal?
</div>


---
## Multiple regression of diamonds data

Now the relationship between `log(price)` and `carats`
```{r fig.height=3.4}
plot(log(diamonds$Price)~diamonds$Carats,xlab="Carats",ylab="Log Price",col='cyan4')
abline(lm(log(Price)~Carats,data=diamonds),col='red3',lty=10,lwd=2)
```

--
<div class="question">
Is this more "linear" than what we had before?
</div>


---
## Multiple regression of diamonds data

Next, `price` and `color`.
```{r fig.height=3.4}
boxplot(Price~Color,data=diamonds,ylab="Price",xlab="Color",col=rainbow(15))
```

--
<div class="question">
What do you think of this plot?
</div>


---
## Multiple regression of diamonds data

How about, `log(price)` and `color` instead
```{r fig.height=3.4}
boxplot(log(Price)~Color,data=diamonds,ylab="Log Price",xlab="Color",col=rainbow(15))
```

--
<div class="question">
How about this plot?
</div>


---
## Multiple regression of diamonds data

Next, `price` and `clarity`.
```{r fig.height=3.4}
boxplot(Price~Clarity,data=diamonds,ylab="Price",xlab="Clarity",col=rainbow(15))
```

--
<div class="question">
What do you think of this plot?
</div>


---
## Multiple regression of diamonds data

```{r fig.height=3.4}

```

--
<div class="question">
How about this plot?
</div>


---
## Multiple regression of diamonds data

Next, `price` and `Certification`.
```{r fig.height=3.4}
boxplot(Price~Certification,data=diamonds,ylab="Price",xlab="Certification",col=rainbow(15))
```

--
<div class="question">
What do you think of this plot?
</div>


---
## Multiple regression of diamonds data

How about, `log(price)` and `Certification` instead
```{r fig.height=3.4}
boxplot(log(Price)~Certification,data=diamonds,ylab="Log Price",xlab="Certification",
        col=rainbow(15))
```

--
<div class="question">
How about this plot?
</div>



---
## Multiple regression of diamonds data

Let's make some plots to explore interactions. First, `log(price)` and `Carats` by `Color`
```{r fig.height=3.6}
xyplot(log(Price)~Carats|Color,data=diamonds,group=Color,type=c("p","r"),col.line="red4")
```

--
<div class="question">
Is there an interaction effect?
</div>


---
## Multiple regression of diamonds data

Next, `log(price)` and `Carats` by `Clarity`
```{r fig.height=3.6}
xyplot(log(Price)~Carats|Clarity,data=diamonds,group=Clarity,type=c("p","r"),col.line="red4")
```

--
<div class="question">
Is there an interaction effect?
</div>


---
## Multiple regression of diamonds data

Next, `log(price)` and `Carats` by `Certification`
```{r fig.height=3.6}
xyplot(log(Price)~Carats|Certification,data=diamonds,group=Certification,type=c("p","r"),
       col.line="red4")
```

--
<div class="question">
Is there an interaction effect?
</div>


---
## Multiple regression of diamonds data

We also can examine interactions among categorical variables
```{r fig.height=3.6}
bwplot(log(Price)~Clarity|Color,data = diamonds)
```

--
<div class="question">
Is there an interaction effect?

---
## Multiple regression of diamonds data

- We see some evidence of non-normality, non-linearity (with `Carats`) and non-constant variance overall. 

- Taking the log transformation helped with those. 

- We might need a quadratic term for `Carats`. Maybe?

- We might also consider interactions between `Clarity` and `Color`.

- Let's mean center the numerical predictors (just `Carat`)  to avoid multicollinearity.
  ```{r}
diamonds$CaratsCent <- diamonds$Carats - mean(diamonds$Carats)
diamonds$CaratsCent2 <- diamonds$CaratsCent^2
```

- Based on our EDA, our candidate model is
.block[
.small[
$$\boldsymbol{y} = \boldsymbol{X}\boldsymbol{\beta} + \boldsymbol{\epsilon}; \ \ \boldsymbol{\epsilon} \sim N(0, \sigma^2 \boldsymbol{I}).$$
]
]

  where $\boldsymbol{X}$ contains Carats, $\textrm{Carats}^2$, Color, Clarity, Certification, and Color:Clarity.
  

---
## Diamonds data: basic MLR

First, a MLR model with only main effects
.large[
```{r}
Model1 <- lm(Price~CaratsCent+Color+Clarity+Certification,data=diamonds);summary(Model1)
```
]


---
## Multiple regression of diamonds data

By the way, we can change the baseline levels for the categorical variables.
.large[
```{r}
Model1 <- lm(Price~CaratsCent+relevel(Color,ref="E")+Clarity+Certification,data=diamonds);summary(Model1)
```
]


---
## Diamonds data: model assessment

```{r fig.height=3.3}
plot(Model1$residual~diamonds$CaratsCent,ylab="Residual",col='navy')
abline(0,0,col="red4")
```

.block[
Clearly, some problems!

Model2 <- lm(log(Price)~CaratsCent+CaratsCent2+Clarity+Color+Certification,data=diamonds);summary(Model2)
```
]

---
## Diamonds data: nested F test

- Let's do a nested $F$-test to see if all the interaction terms between `Clarity` and `Color` are important.

--

- I won't print the results because there are too many interactions but you should run `summary(Model2_inter)` yourself to see.
  ```{r}
Model2_inter <- lm(log(Price)~CaratsCent+CaratsCent2+Clarity*Color+Certification,
                   data=diamonds);
anova(Model2,Model2_inter)
```

--
  <div class="question">
What do we conclude?
</div>

--

- This confirms our EDA.
