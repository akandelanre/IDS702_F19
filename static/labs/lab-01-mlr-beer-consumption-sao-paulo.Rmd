# Introduction

The purpose of this lab is to give you additional practice working with multiple linear regression. You will also write your own code for doing $k$-fold cross validation. The lab is based on the Kaggle beer consumption dataset found here:  https://www.kaggle.com/dongeorge/beer-consumption-sao-paulo/. Read more about the problem and dataset under the description section of the link.

Kaggle is a great online community of data scientists. To learn more about Kaggle, follow this link: https://www.kaggle.com/getting-started/44916.

In this lab you will demonstrate the impacts of variables on beer consumption in a given region and the consumption forecast for certain scenarios. The data (sample) were collected in Sao Paulo, Brazil, in a university area, where there are some parties with groups of students from 18 to 28 years of age (average).
   
<!-- # Packages -->

<!-- In this lab we will work with the `tidyverse` and `broom` packages. We can install and load them with the following: -->

<!-- ```{marginfigure} -->
<!-- When you install the tidyverse package, a long list of packages get installed with it. However when you load it (with the `library` function) only a few of them get loaded, e.g. `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, and `forcats`. The broom package is installed with the tidyverse, but we need to load it separately in order to make use of it. -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ```{r eval = FALSE} -->
<!-- install.packages("tidyverse") -->
<!-- library(tidyverse)  -->
<!-- library(broom) -->
<!-- ``` -->



# Housekeeping

## R/RStudio

You all should have R and RStudio installed on your computers by now. If you do not, first install the latest version of R here: https://cran.rstudio.com (remember to select the right installer for your operating system). Next, install the latest version of RStudio here: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/. Scroll down to the "Installers for Supported Platforms" section and find the right installer for your operating system.

## R Markdown

You are required to use R Markdown to type up this lab report. If you do not already know how to use R markdown, here is a very (very!) basic R Markdown template: https://akandelanre.github.io/IDS702_F19/labs/resources/LabReport.Rmd. Refer to the resources tab of the course website (here: https://akandelanre.github.io/IDS702_F19/resources/) for links to help you learn how to use R markdown. 

## Gradescope

You MUST submit both your .Rmd and .pdf files to the course site on Gradescope here: https://www.gradescope.com/courses/57701/assignments. Make sure to knit to pdf and not html; ask the TA about knitting to pdf if you cannot figure it out. Be sure to submit under the right assignment entry.

<!-- ## Create a GitHub account -->

<!-- Everyone should have a GitHub account by now. You won't need to use version control for this lab but you will need it for the team projects so you might as well create an account now. It is quite easy to use git/GitHub within RStudio If you have a GitHub account, skip the rest of this section.  -->

<!-- If you do not yet have a GitHub account, create one at https://github.com/. Try to incorporate your actual name and pick a name you will be comfortable revealing to your future boss! -->



<!-- # Warm up -->

<!-- **Pick one team member to complete the steps in this section while the others contribute to the discussion but do not actually touch the files on their computer.** -->

<!-- Before we introduce the data, let's warm up with some simple exercises. -->

<!-- ## YAML:  -->

<!-- Open the R Markdown (Rmd) file in your project, change the author name to your **team** name, and knit the document. -->

<!-- ## Committing and pushing changes: -->

<!-- - Go to the **Git** pane in your RStudio.  -->
<!-- - View the **Diff** and confirm that you are happy with the changes. -->
<!-- - Add a commit message like "Update team name" in the **Commit message** box and hit **Commit**. -->
<!-- - Click on **Push**. This will prompt a dialogue box where you first need to enter your user name, and then your password. -->

<!-- ## Pulling changes: -->

<!-- Now, the remaining team members who have not been concurrently making these changes on their projects should click on the **Pull** button in their Git pane and observe that the changes are now reflected on their projects as well. -->



# The Data

Download the data (named `consumo_cerveja.csv`) from Sakai and save it locally to the same directory as your R markdown file. To find the data file on Sakai, go to Resources $\rightarrow$ Datasets $\rightarrow$ Lab Datasets $\rightarrow$ Lab 1. Once you have downloaded the data file into the SAME folder as your R markdown file, load and clean the data by using the following R code.

```{marginfigure}
It is always a good idea to take a look at the first few rows of the raw file to see what the data looks like before loading the data. In this raw 'consumo_cerveja' file, you will notice that commas are actually used both as decimals and to separate the columns. Thus, you need to let R know by specifying the *sep* and *dec* options as in the code.
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
beer <- read.csv("consumo_cerveja.csv",stringsAsFactors = FALSE, sep = ",",dec=",")
# rename the variables
beer$date <- beer$Data
beer$temp_median_c <- beer$Temperatura.Media..C.
beer$temp_min_c <- beer$Temperatura.Minima..C.
beer$temp_max_c <- beer$Temperatura.Maxima..C.
beer$precip_mm <- beer$Precipitacao..mm.
beer$weekend <- factor(beer$Final.de.Semana)
beer$beer_cons_liters <- as.numeric(beer$Consumo.de.cerveja..litros.)
beer <- beer[ , 8:ncol(beer)]
```

After renaming the variables using the code above, your data will be saved in the object `beer`, and the relevant variables plus their meanings are given in the table below:

Variable    | Description
:------------- | :------------ 
date | Date the data for each observation was recorded.
temp_median_c | Median temperature in $^0C$.
temp_min_c | Minimum temperature in $^0C$.
temp_max_c | Maximum temperature in $^0C$.
precip_mm  | Precipitation in $mm$.
weekend | Indicator variable for weekend: 1 = weekend, 0 = weekday.
beer_cons_liters | Beer consumption in liters.



# Exercises

Treat the variable `beer_cons_liters` as your response variable and the other variables as potential predictors.

1. Make a histogram of `beer_cons_liters`. Describe the distribution. Is the normality assumption a plausible one here? If you think the histogram does not look normal enough, make a histogram of `log(beer_cons_liters)`. Does that look more "normal" than `beer_cons_liters`? 

    *If no, use `beer_cons_liters` as your response variable for the remaining questions. If yes, use `log(beer_cons_liters)` as your response variable instead for the remaining questions.*

2. Make exploratory plots of `beer_cons_liters` (or `log(beer_cons_liters)`) versus each potential predictor. Are all the relationships linear? If any one of them is nonlinear, describe the relationship.

3. Does it make sense to include all three of `temp_median_c`, `temp_min_c` and `temp_max_c` as predictors in a MLR model for predicting `beer_cons_liters` (or `log(beer_cons_liters)`)? Justify your response in one or two sentences.

4. Fit a linear model for `beer_cons_liters` (or `log(beer_cons_liters)`) using `weekend`, `precip_mm`, and `temp_median_c` as your predictors. Interpret all the parameters of the fitted regression model in context of the data. What percent of the variability in `beer_cons_liters` (or `log(beer_cons_liters)`) is explained by your model?

5. Which of the variables appears to be the best covariate for explaining or predicting beer consumption? Why?

6. Are there any potential limitations of the model you have fit? If yes, what are two potential limitations?

7. Compute the in-sample root mean squared error (RMSE) for the regression model in question 4. Refer back to the class notes for details on how to compute in-sample (or within-sample) RMSE.

8. Write a code for doing $k$-fold cross validation. Refer back to the class notes for details on $k$-fold cross validation. Let $k=10$ and use average RMSE as the metric for quantifying predictive error. What is the average RMSE for the model in question 4 above?

    *Hint: if you are not sure how to begin writing your code for doing the cross validation, you should consider writing a "for loop". A "for loop" is actually not the most efficient way to get this done but it will work just fine here. If you don't know how to write a "for loop", use the skeleton code below as a guide for writing your own "for loop" for this question.*
    ```{r eval = FALSE}
# Suppose your data is stored in the object "Data"
# First set a seed to ensure your results are reproducible
set.seed(...) # use whatever number you want
# Now randomly re-shuffle the data
Data <- Data[sample(nrow(Data)),]
# Define the number of folds you want
K <- ...
# Define a matrix to save your results into
RSME <- matrix(0,nrow=K,ncol=1)
# Split the row indexes into k equal parts
kth_fold <- cut(seq(1,nrow(Data)),breaks=K,labels=FALSE)
# Now write the for loop for the k-fold cross validation
for(k in 1:K){
# Split your data into the training and test datasets
test_index <- which(kth_fold==k)
train <- Data[-test_index,]
test <- Data[test_index,]
# Now that you've split the data, 
RSME[k,] <- ... # write your code for computing RMSE for each k here
# You should consider using your code for question 7 above
}
... #Calculate the average of all values in the RSME matrix here.
```

9. Extend the model in question 4 to include interaction terms between `weekend` and the other two predictors. Are the interaction terms significant?

    *To include an interaction term between a continuous/numerical variable x1 and a factor variable x2 in your linear model, use*
    ```{r eval = FALSE}
"model name here" <- lm(y ~ x1 + x2 + x1:x2)
```

10. Use your code for the $k$-fold cross validation from question 8 to compute the average RMSE for the new model in question 9. Is the new RMSE model lower or higher? What can you infer from that?
