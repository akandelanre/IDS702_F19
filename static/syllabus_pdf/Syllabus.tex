\section{Course Overview}
Statistical models are necessary for analyzing the type of multivariate (often large) datasets that are usually encountered in data science and statistical science. This is a graduate level course, within the curriculum for Duke's Master in Interdisciplinary Data Science (MIDS) program, that aims to provide students with the statistical data analysis tools needed to succeed as data scientists. 

In this course, you will learn the general work flow for building statistical models and using them to answer inferential questions. You will learn several parametric modeling techniques such as generalized linear models, models for multilevel data and time series models. You will also learn to handle messy data, including data with missing or erroneous values, and data with outliers or non-standard distributions. You will be able to assess model fit, validate model assumptions and more generally, check whether proposed statistical models are appropriate for any given data. You will also learn causal inference under the potential outcomes framework. Should time permit, we may also briefly cover nonparametric models such as classification and regression trees. 

Although this course emphasizes data analysis over rigorous mathematical theory, students who wish to explore the mathematical theory in more detail than what is covered in class are welcome to engage with and request further reading materials from the instructor outside of class.


\section{Learning Objectives}
By the end of this course, students should be able to
\begin{itemize}[label= {\color{darkblue}{\ArrowBoldRightStrobe}}]
	\item Use the statistical methods and models covered in class to analyze real multivariate data that intersect with various fields. 
	\item Assess the adequacy of statistical models to any given data and make a decision on what to do in cases when certain models are not appropriate for a given dataset.
	\item Cleanup and analyze messy datasets using approaches covered in class.
	\item Hone collaborative and presentations skills through the process of consistent team work on and class presentations of team projects.
\end{itemize}



\section{Prerequisites}
Students are expected to know all topics covered in the MIDS summer course review and boot camp. These include basic statistical inference including hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, linear regression with one predictor, and exploratory data analysis methods. Students are also expected to be familiar with \textsf{R}. Due to space constraints, the course is open only to students in the MIDS program.


\section{Class Materials}
Lecture notes and slides, lab exercises and other reading resources will be posted on the course website. We will only loosely follow the textbooks.


\section{Graded Work} 
Graded work for the course will consist of methods and data analysis assignments, team projects, and a final project. 
\begin{itemize}[label= {\color{darkblue}{\ArrowBoldRightStrobe}}]
	\item There is no final exam. Students' final grades will be determined as follows:
	\begin{table}[h]
		\centering
		\begin{tabular}{ll}
			Component & Percentage \\ \hline
			Methods and Data Analysis Assignments & 30\% \\
			Final Project & 30\% \\ 
			Team Project 1 & 15\% \\
			Team Project 2 & 15\% \\
			Lab Assignments & 10\% \\ \hline 
		\end{tabular}
	\end{table}
	
	\item There are no make-ups for assignments or the projects except for medical or familial emergencies or for reasons approved by the instructor before the due date. See the instructor in advance of relevant due dates to discuss possible alternatives. 
	
	\item Grades may be curved at the end of the semester. Cumulative averages of 90\% -- 100\% are guaranteed at least an A-, 80\% -- 89\% at least a B-, and 70\% -- 79\% at least a C-, however the exact ranges for letter grades will be determined after the final exam. 
\end{itemize}


\section{Descriptions of graded work}
\subsection{Methods and Data Analysis Assignments}
Methods and Data Analysis assignments are posted on the IDS 702 course website. Students turn in these assignments at the beginning of class on the due date. Students are permitted to work with others on the assignments, but each person must write up and turn in her or his own answers. The Methods and Data Analysis assignments include questions on the computational and the mathematical aspects of the methods that underpin the statistical models we learn during the semester, and questions that ask students to apply the modeling skills discussed during the semester. The assignments must be typed up using \textsf{R} Markdown, \LaTeX or another word processor, and submitted on \href{https://www.gradescope.com/courses/57701/assignments}{Gradescope} under Assignments. Note that you will not be able to make online submissions after the due date, so be sure to submit before or by the Gradescope-specified deadline.

\subsection{Lab Assignments}
The objective of the lab assignments is to give you more hands-on experience with data analysis using R. The labs times also gives you an additional platform to ask for help for your team and individual projects. Lab attendance is not mandatory on days when team presentations will not hold, however, each lab assignment should be submitted in timely fashion on the due date. You are REQUIRED to use R Markdown to type up your lab reports.

\subsection{Team Projects}
For the team projects, students work in teams to analyze data selected by the instructor. Students write a report with their data analysis findings. Students may have the opportunity to present their results in class. Detailed instructions will be made available later on the website.

\subsection{Final Project}
For the final project, students analyze a data-based research question of their choosing, subject to the instructor's approval. The data should comprise several variables amenable to statistical analyses via modeling. Students can bring in their own research data sets, or they can ask the instructor for assistance with identifying appropriate data. Students present their results in a poster session. Detailed instructions will be made available later on the website.


\section{Late Submission Policy} 
\begin{itemize}
	\item  You will lose 50\% of the total points on each homework if you submit within the first 24 hours after it is due, and 100\% of the total points if you submit later than that.
	\item You will lose 40\% of the total points on each lab if you submit within the first 24 hours after it is due, and 100\% of the total points if you submit later than that.
\end{itemize}
