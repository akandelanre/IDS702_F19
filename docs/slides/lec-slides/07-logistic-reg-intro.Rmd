# Relative risk and odds ratio



---
## Introduction

- So far in this course, our response variables have been continuous.

--

- Sometimes, we would also like to build models for binary outcome variables. For example,

  + $Y = 1$: healthy, $Y = 0$: not healthy
  + $Y = 1$: employed, $Y = 0$: not employed
  + $Y = 1$: win, $Y = 0$: lose

--

- Often, we want to predict or explain the binary outcome variable from several predictors.

--

- Linear regression is NOT appropriate, because normality for the response variable (and errors) makes no sense in this case.

--

- This brings us to .hlight[logistic regression], the most popular model for binary outcomes.

--

- First let's review relative risk, odds and odds ratios.



---
## Absolute risk and relative risk

- $Y$: binary response variable, $X$: binary predictor

<br />       | $Y=1$       | $Y=0$       |
:----------- | :---------: | :---------: |
$X=1$        | a           | b           |
$X=0$        | c           | d           |

- .hlight[Absolute risk] of $Y=1$ for level $X=1$: $\dfrac{a}{(a+b)}$

- .hlight[Absolute risk] of $Y=1$ for level $X=0$: $\dfrac{c}{(c+d)}$

- .hlight[Relative risk (RR)]: $\dfrac{a/(a+b)}{c/(c+d)}$

--
<div class="question">
In which fields do you think relative risk might be useful?
</div>



---
## Odds and odds ratio

- $Y$: binary response variable, $X$: binary predictor

<br />       | $Y=1$       | $Y=0$       |
:----------- | :---------: | :---------: |
$X=1$        | a           | b           |
$X=0$        | c           | d           |

- .hlight[Odds] of $Y=1$ for level $X=1$: $\dfrac{a}{b}$

- .hlight[Odds] of $Y=1$ for level $X=0$: $\dfrac{c}{d}$

- .hlight[Odds ratio (OR)]: $\dfrac{a/b}{c/d}$

--
<div class="question">
In which fields do you think odds or odds ratio might be useful?

## Probabilities and odds: motivating example

- Physicians' Health Study (1989): randomized experiment with 22071 male physicians at least 40 years old.

--

- Half the subjects were assigned to take aspirin every other day.

--

- The other half were assigned to take a placebo pill.

--

- Here are the number of people in each cell of the contingency table

<br />         | Heart attack  | No heart attack |
:------------- | :-----------: | :-------------: |
Aspirin        | 104           | 10933           |
Placebo        | 189           | 10845           |



---
## Absolute risk and relative risk for physicians health study

- Physicians Health Study

<br />         | Heart attack  | No heart attack |
:------------- | :-----------: | :-------------: |
Aspirin        | 104           | 10933           |
Placebo        | 189           | 10845           |

- .block[Relative risk of a heart attack when taking aspirin versus when taking a placebo equals]
$$\textrm{RR} = \dfrac{104/(104+10933)}{189/(189+10845)} = 0.55$$

--

- .block[Odds of having a heart attack when taking aspirin over odds of a heart attach when talking a placebo (odds ratio)]
$$\textrm{OR} = \dfrac{104/10933}{189/10845} = 0.546$$



---
## Interpreting odds ratios and relative risks

  <br />       | $Y=1$       | $Y=0$       |
:----------- | :---------: | :---------: |
$X=1$        | a           | b           |
$X=0$        | c           | d           |

- When the variables $X$ and $Y$ are independent 
$$OR = 1; \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ RR = 1$$
  
--

- When subjects with level $X=1$ are more likely to have $Y=1$ than subjects with level $X=0$, then 
$$OR > 1; \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ RR > 1$$
  
--

- When subjects with level $X=1$ are less likely to have $Y=1$ than subjects with level $X=0$, then 
$$OR < 1; \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ RR < 1$$


---
## Relative risk vs. absolute risk: smoking and lung cancer

- Small or large values of relative risk may or may not be significant depending on the base rate.

--

- Thus, it can be more helpful or meaningful to present both the absolute risk and RR.

--

- For example,
  + Percentage of smokers who get lung cancer: 8% (conservative estimate)
  + Relative risk of lung cancer for smokers: 800%
  + That is, getting lung cancer is not commonplace, even for smokers but, smokers’chances of getting lung cancer are much, much higher than non-smokers’ chances.
  + The absolute risk helps place the RR in context.

# Logistic regression



---
## What if we want to use regression to predict binary outcomes?

- RR and OR can be useful, but it would be great to be able to do either or both in a model setting; especially when we have multiple predictors.

--

- Let's start small: suppose we want to use linear regression to predict binary $y$ from some predictor $x$. 

--

- Recall that the simple linear regression model is
.block[
.small[
$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i} + \epsilon_i; \ \ \epsilon_i \overset{iid}{\sim} N(0, \sigma^2).$$
]
]

- Also recall that this means the model implies that $y$ could be any continuous value, when in fact for a binary outcome, it has to be exactly zero or one.

--

- Therefore, linear regression is not a reasonable model here. 

--

- <div class="question">
What distribution do you think would be more ideal for y?
</div>


---
## More appropriate distribution for $y$

- Assume for any observation $i$ that
.block[
.small[
$$\Pr[y_i = 1 | x_i] = \pi_i \ \ \textrm{and} \ \ \Pr[y_i = 0 | x_i] = 1-\pi_i $$
]
]

  where $\pi_i$ is some function of $x_i$.

--
  
- Notice that this is simply a .hlight[Bernoulli distribution] or a .hlight[Binomial distribution] (with number of trials = 1) where the probability $\pi_i$ is allowed to be potentially different for each observation $i$.

--

- What then should the function that connects $\pi_i$ to $x_i$ look like? 

--

- Some "not so ideal" options could be:
  + .hlight[Linear]:
  .block[
.small[
$$\pi_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i}; \ \ \ \ \ \ \textrm{But } \pi_i \textrm{ can be outside } [0,1]!$$
]
]
    
  + .hlight[Log-linear]:
  .block[
.small[
$$\textrm{log}(\pi_i) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i} \ \ \Rightarrow \ \ \pi_i = e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i}}; \ \ \ \ \ \ \textrm{But } \pi_i \textrm{ can be } > 1!$$
]
]



---
## Logistic regression model

- From the log-linear function, we can already see a potential solution to the $\pi_i>1$ problem: we can divide $e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i}}$ by a denominator that will always be greater than it.

--

- Thus, we can use the function
.block[
.small[
$$\pi_i = \dfrac{e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i}}{1 + e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i}}  \ \ \Rightarrow \ \ \textrm{log} \left(\dfrac{\pi_i}{1-\pi_i}\right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i.$$
]
]
  $\textrm{log} \left(\dfrac{\pi_i}{1-\pi_i}\right)$ is called the .hlight[logit function], also written as $\textrm{logit}(\pi_i)$. Notice that the logit function is essentially the .hlight[log-odds], i.e., log of the odds.

--

- We can then formally write the .hlight[logistic regression model] as
.block[
.small[
$$
\begin{split}
\Pr[y_i = 1 | x_i] = \pi_i \ \ \textrm{and} \ \ \Pr[y_i = 0 | x_i] = 1-\pi_i; \ \ \ & \textrm{log}\left(\dfrac{\pi_i}{1-\pi_i}\right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i, \\
\textrm{OR } \ \ \ y_i | x_i \sim \textrm{Bernoulli}(\pi_i); \ \ \ & \textrm{log}\left(\dfrac{\pi_i}{1-\pi_i}\right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i.
\end{split}
$$
]
]
    


---
## Solving the logit equation

- Let's see how to go from $\textrm{logit}(\pi_i)$ back to $\pi_i$.
.block[
.small[
$$
\begin{split}
\textrm{logit}(\pi_i) = \textrm{log}\left(\dfrac{\pi_i}{1-\pi_i}\right) & = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i \\
\Rightarrow \ e^{\textrm{log}\left(\dfrac{\pi_i}{1-\pi_i}\right)} & = e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i} \\
\Rightarrow \ \dfrac{\pi_i}{1-\pi_i} & = e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i} \\
\Rightarrow \ \pi_i & = e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i} (1-\pi_i) \\
\Rightarrow \ \pi_i & = e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i} - \pi_i e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i} \\
\Rightarrow \ \pi_i + \pi_i e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i} & = e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i}  \\
\Rightarrow \ \pi_i (1+e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i}) & = e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i}  \\
\therefore \ \pi_i & = \dfrac{e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i}}{1 + e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i}} \\
\end{split}
$$
]
]

--

- By the way, another function that works well for linking $\pi_i$ to $x_i$ is the .hlight[probit function]; the quantile function (or inverse of the cumulative distribution function) associated with the standard normal distribution.

--

- We will formally explore the .hlight[probit regression model] later in the course.



---
## Interpreting coefficients

- From
.block[
.small[
$$\textrm{log}\left(\dfrac{\pi_i}{1-\pi_i}\right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i$$
]
]

  we can see that "*as we increase $x$ by 1 unit, we increase the log-odds of $y$ being 1 by $\beta_1$*".

--

- Equivalently, from
.block[
.small[
$$\dfrac{\pi_i}{1-\pi_i} = e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i} = e^{\beta_0}  e^{\beta_1 x_i}$$
]
]

  we can see that "*as we increase $x$ by 1 unit, we increase the odds for $y$ by a multiplicative effect of $e^{\beta_1}$*".

--

- With mean-centered $x$, $\beta_0$ is the log-odds for $y$ at the mean of $x$, and $e^{\beta_0}$ is the odds for $y$ at the mean of $x$.

--

- Often much easier to interpret results by graphing the (predicted) probabilities for values of $x$.



---
## Interpreting coefficients: categorical predictors

When $x$ is binary,

- .hlight[Odds] of $y=1$ for level $x=1$: $e^{\beta_0}  e^{\beta_1 (1)} = e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1}$

--

- .hlight[Odds] of $y=1$ for level $x=0$: $e^{\beta_0}  e^{\beta_1 (0)} = e^{\beta_0}$

--

- .hlight[Odds ratio (OR)]: $\dfrac{e^{\beta_0}  e^{\beta_1}}{e^{\beta_0}} = e^{\beta_1}$

--

- Thus, $e^{\beta_1}$ has a nice interpretation as the odds ratio when $x=1$ versus $x=0$, and $\beta_1$ is the corresponding log odds ratio.

--

When $x$ is categorical with $K > 2$ levels, the corresponding $e^{\beta_{1k}}$ is the odds ratio when $x=k$ versus whichever level is set as the baseline.

--

It is also easy to calculate relative risk from the results of the logistic model.

---
## Estimation of coefficients

- Use maximum likelihood estimation.

--

- Basic idea is to find the values of $(\beta_0, \beta_1)$ that make the observed values of Y most likely to have arisen.

--

- Requires multivariate calculus and numerical methods (Newton Raphson algorithm) for estimation.

--

- R to the rescue yet again: R does it for us!!!

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height="250px"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/phew.gif")
```


---
## Intervals and significance tests

- As with all coefficients, the standard errors represent chance deviations in the estimated values $(\hat{\beta}_0, \hat{\beta}_1)$ from the actual values $(\beta_0, \beta_1)$

--

- Confidence intervals is usually based on large-sample normal distribution approximations. For example,
  + $95%$ CI for $\hat{\beta}_1$:
  .block[
.small[
$$\hat{\beta}_1 \pm 1.96 \times \textrm{SE}_{\hat{\beta}_1}$$
]
]
  + $95%$ CI for $e^{\hat{\beta}_1}$:
  .block[
.small[
$$e^{\left[\hat{\beta}_1 \pm 1.96 \times \textrm{SE}_{\hat{\beta}_1}\right]}$$
]
]

--

- Confidence intervals can also be computed using the profile-likelihood approach. 

--

- Although both methods can yield similar CIs with large sample sizes, the profile-likelihood limits can often have better small-sample properties than the asymptotic approximations. R can compute both.



---
## Logistic regression with one predictor: The Challenger analysis

- Let's start with a very small dataset to illustrate logistic regression with one predictor.

--

- On January 28, 1986, the space shuttle Challenger exploded in the early stages of its flight, killing all crew members.

--

- The cause of the explosion was a failure of O-rings, seals on the booster rockets that prevent hot gases from escaping the rockets. 

--

- When the O-rings failed, one booster rocket caught on fire. The fire eventually burned a hole in the main fuel tank rocket, allowing elements to mix together to produce the catastrophic explosion.

--

- The ambient temperature was 36 degrees on the morning of the launch. 



---
## Logistic regression with one predictor: The Challenger analysis

- Some of NASA’s scientists worried that the O-rings may not perform well in low temperatures; they had no experience with launches in such temperatures.

--

- To aid their decision making process, the NASA scientists examined data from previous shuttle flights. 

--

- They graphed the number of O-ring failures versus the ambient temperature for all flights where there was at least one O-ring failure.

--

- They obtained these data by examining the booster rockets that fall to the Earth after being jettisoned during a flight.



---
## The Challenger analysis

The data is in the file `challenger.csv` on Sakai.

```{r}
challenger <- read.csv("data/challenger.csv",header=T,colClasses=c("numeric","factor"))
challenger
```


---
## The Challenger analysis

The data is in the file `challenger.csv` on Sakai.

```{r fig.height=3.4}
colnames(challenger) <- c("temp", "failure")
challenger$fail01 <- rep(0, 24); challenger$fail01[challenger$failure=="Yes"] <- 1
plot(challenger$fail01,x=challenger$temp,xlab="Temperature",ylab="Failure",col="navy",pch=17)
```

This is not easy to interpret. We can try a box plot.

---
## The Challenger analysis

This doesn't really portray a prediction of failure from temperature, but it's somewhat useful to get an overall sense of the data.

```{r fig.height=3.4}
boxplot(challenger$temp~challenger$fail01,ylab="Temperature",xlab="Failure")
```

Be careful; we don't have that many data points. Let's continue nonetheless.


---
## The Challenger analysis

Let's fit the following logistic regression to the data.
.block[
.small[
$$\textrm{failure}_i | \textrm{temp}_i \sim \textrm{Bernoulli}(\pi_i); \ \ \ \textrm{log}\left(\dfrac{\pi_i}{1-\pi_i}\right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \textrm{temp}_i$$
]
]

```{r fig.height=3.4}
logreg <- glm(fail01~temp,family=binomial(link=logit),data=challenger); summary(logreg)
```



---
## The Challenger analysis

Let's mean-center the temperature for interpretation.
```{r fig.height=3.4}
challenger$tempcent <- challenger$temp - mean(challenger$temp)
logreg <- glm(fail01~tempcent,family=binomial(link=logit),data=challenger)
summary(logreg)
```


---
## The Challenger analysis

Confidence intervals for the coefficients. Remember that this is on the log-odds scale.
```{r fig.height=3.4}
confint.default(logreg) #Asymptotic
confint(logreg) #Based on the profile-likelihood
```

--
<div class="question">
Can you interpret the intervals?
</div>

---
## The Challenger analysis

Let's transform to the odds scale.
```{r fig.height=3.4}
exp(confint.default(logreg)) #Asymptotic
exp(confint(logreg)) #Based on the profile-likelihood
```

--
<div class="question">
Can you interpret the intervals?
</div>



---
## The Challenger analysis

We can get the predicted probabilities for the observed cases.

```{r fig.height=3.4}
predprobs <- predict(logreg,type="response");
cbind(predprobs,challenger) #use predict(logreg, type="link") for the logit scale
```


---
## The Challenger analysis

Useful to examine a plot of predicted probabilities by $x$.

```{r fig.height=3.4}
plot(y=predprobs,x=challenger$temp,xlab="Temperature",ylab="Pred. Probability of Failure",
     type="o",col=c("red4","navy"))
```



---
## The Challenger analysis

Actually, let's make the plot across various values to get a smooth curve for the predicted probabilities.

```{r fig.height=3.4}
newdata <- data.frame(tempcent=(seq(50,85,length.out=50)-mean(challenger$temp)))
newpreds <- predict(logreg, newdata, type="response")
plot(y=newpreds,x=newdata$temp,xlab="Temperature",ylab="Pred. Probability of Failure",
     type="o",col=c("red4","navy"))
```


---
## Final notes

- Let's stop here today.

- In the next class, we will pick off from here and fit a logistic regression with multiple predictors

- We will see how to do EDA when dealing with a binary response variable.

- We will also learn to do model assessment and validation for logistic models.
