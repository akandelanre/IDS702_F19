# Checking model fit


---
## Predicting nba wins

- Let's fit a logistic regression with one predictor to NBA data for 4 seasons from the 2014/2015 season to the 2017/2018 season.

- Suppose we want to see how the amount of points a team let's the opponents score affects their odds of winning.

- For this simple example, we will focus on data from four teams: GSW (Golden State Warriors), SAS (San Antonio Spurs), CAV (Cleveland Cavaliers), and TOR (Toronto Raptors).

- The data is in the file `nba_games_stats_reduced.csv` on Sakai.

- Ideally, we should use more information (and that data is actually available) to predict wins but let's continue for illustrative purposes. 


---
## Predicting nba wins

```{r fig.height=3}
nba <- read.csv("data/nba_games_stats_reduced.csv",header=T)
colnames(nba)[3] <- "Opp"
nba$win <- rep(0,nrow(nba)); nba$win[nba$WINorLOSS=="W"] <- 1
head(nba); dim(nba)
summary(nba[,-4])
```


---
## Predicting nba wins

.block[
.small[
$$
\textrm{win}_i | \textrm{Opp}_i \sim \textrm{Bernoulli}(\pi_i); \ \ \ \textrm{log}\left(\dfrac{\pi_i}{1-\pi_i}\right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \textrm{Opp}_i
$$
]
]

```{r fig.height=3}
nbareg <- glm(win~Opp,family=binomial(link=logit),data=nba); summary(nbareg)
```

  .block[For every additional point an opponent scores in a game, the odds of winning decreases by 8%: exp(-0.08) = 0.92.]

 
 
---
## Residuals

There are various options for residuals when working with glms. For logistic regression in particular, we have

- .hlight[Response residuals]
  .block[
.small[
$$e_i = y_i - \hat{\pi}_i.$$
]
]

- .hlight[Pearson residuals]
  .block[
.small[
$$e_i^P = \dfrac{y_i - \hat{\pi}_i}{\hat{\pi}_i(1-\hat{\pi}_i)}$$
]
]

  which should be more uniform.

- .hlight[Deviance residuals]
  .block[
.small[
$$e_i^D = \textrm{sign}(y_i - \hat{\pi}_i) \times 2\left(y_i \textrm{log}\dfrac{y_i}{\hat{\pi}_i} + (1-y_i) \textrm{log}\dfrac{1-y_i}{1-\hat{\pi}_i} \right).$$
]
]
 
 They are the default in R when using the .hlight[residuals()] function. We will talk a bit more about deviance later.
 
 

---
## Checking the fit of model

- Unlike what we had for linear regression, just looking at the residuals does not work well here.
  + They are always positive when $Y=1$ and always negative when $Y=0$.
  + Also, constant variance is not an assumption of logistic regression.
  
     <div class="question">
    Why is that the case?
    </div>
    Because the variance of the Bernoulli distribution in this setup depends on each observation $i$: $\mathbb{V}[Y_i] = \pi_i(1-\pi_i)$.
  + We also do not have normality of residuals to work with either.


- What we can do is check to see if the function of predictors is well specified using .hlight[binned residuals].

- We can also see how well our model predicts using
 + Confusion matrix
 + ROC curves
 


---
## Binned residuals

- Compute raw (response) residuals for fitted logistic regression.

- Order observations by values of predicted probabilities (or predictor values) from the fitted regression.

- Using ordered data, form $g$ bins of (approximately) equal size. Default: $g = \sqrt{n}$.

- Compute average residual in each bin.

- Plot average residual versus average predicted probability (or average predictor value) for each bin.

- Use the .hlight[arm] package in R.


---
## NBA analysis

```{r fig.height=3}
plot(nbareg,which=1)
```

The residuals are the deviance residuals, while the predicted values are on the linear (logit) scale, that is, $\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i$.

Look to see which cases have large absolute values for cases that don't fit well, but not too useful otherwise.



---
## NBA analysis

Plot binned raw residuals versus predicted probabilities. Load the .hlight[arm] package.

Useful as a "one-stop shopping" plot; especially with many predictors and you want an initial look at model adequacy. Mostly good, although model seems to struggle for fitted values over 0.9.

```{r fig.height=3,message=F}
binnedplot(fitted(nbareg),residuals(nbareg,"resp"),xlab="Pred. probabilities",col.int="red4",
           ylab="Avg. residuals",main="Binned residual plot",col.pts="navy")
```

<!-- The grey lines represent $\pm 2$ SE bands, which we would expect to contain about 95% of the observations. Too few points here to draw any conclusions! -->



---
## NBA analysis

Plot binned raw residuals versus individual predictors.

<!-- Useful as a "one-stop shopping" plot; especially with many predictors and you want an initial look at model adequacy.  -->

Mostly good, although model again seems to struggle for low values of opponent's points. Also, too many points outside the bands. We know some important predictors are missing by construction.

```{r fig.height=3,message=F}
binnedplot(nba$Opp,residuals(nbareg,"resp"),xlab="Opponent's points (centered)",
           col.int="red4",ylab="Avg. residuals",main="Binned residual plot",col.pts="navy")
```

<!-- Again, too few points here to draw any conclusions! You want at least 100 data points before these plots start being useful. -->



---
## Confusion matrix

- Estimated probabilities can be used to predict outcomes.

- For example, we could decide to predict $Y=1$ when the predicted probability exceeds $0.5$ and predict $Y=0$ otherwise.

- We then can determine how many cases we classify correctly and incorrectly.

- Resulting $2 \times 2$ table called the .hlight[confusion matrix].

- When mis-classification rates are high, model may not be an especially good fit to the data.



---
## Confusion matrix

<table>
  <tr>
    <th> </th>
    <th> </th>
    <th colspan="2">Observed</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="2"></th>
    <td style="text-align:center">Y=1</td>
    <td style="text-align:center">Y=0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th rowspan="2">Predicted</th>
    <td height="50px">Y=1</td>
    <td style="text-align:center">TP (True Positives)</td>
    <td style="text-align:center">FP (False Positives)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td height="50px">Y=0</td>
    <td style="text-align:center">FN (False Negatives)</td>
    <td style="text-align:center">TN (True Negatives)</td>
  </tr>
</table>

- .hlight[True positive rate (TPR)] = $\dfrac{TP}{TP+FN}$ (also known as .hlight[sensitivity])

- .hlight[False negative rate (FNR)] = $\dfrac{FN}{TP+FN}$

- .hlight[True negative rate (TNR)] = $\dfrac{TN}{FP+TN}$ (also known as .hlight[specificity])

- .hlight[False positive rate (FPR)] = $\dfrac{FP}{FP+TN}$ (1 - .hlight[specificity])



---
## ROC Curves

- .block[We want high values of sensitivity and low values of (1 - specificity)!]

- The .hlight[receiver operating characteristic (ROC)] curve plots 
  + Sensitivity on Y axis
  + 1 - specificity on X axis
  
- Evaluated at lots of different values for the threshold

- Good fitting logistic regression curves toward the upper left corner, with .hlight[area under the curve (AUC)] near one.

- Make ROC curves in R using the pROC package.

- By the way, we also often define .hlight[accuracy] as $\dfrac{TP + TN}{TP+FN+FP+TN}$. This estimates how well the model predicts correctly overall.



---
## NBA analysis

Let's look at the confusion matrix for the nba data. Load the .hlight[arm] and .hlight[e1071] packages.


```{r fig.height=3,message=F}
Conf_mat <- confusionMatrix(as.factor(ifelse(fitted(nbareg) >= 0.5, "W","L")),
                            nba$WINorLOSS,positive = "W")
Conf_mat$table
Conf_mat$overall["Accuracy"];
Conf_mat$byClass[c("Sensitivity","Specificity")]
```

.hlight[confusionMatrix] produces a lot of output. Print the .hlight[Conf_mat] object to see all of them.



---
## NBA analysis


```{r fig.height=4.5,message=F}
invisible(roc(nba$win,fitted(nbareg),plot=T,print.thres=c(0.3,0.5,0.7),legacy.axes=T,

```

# Logistic regression with multiple predictors


---
## Logistic regression with multiple predictors: motivating example

- In many developing countries, people get their drinking water from wells.

--

- Sometimes these wells are contaminated with the chemical arsenic, which when consumed in high concentrations causes skin and bladder cancer, as well as cardiovascular disease.

--

- Fortunately, in many cases people living near contaminated wells have the opportunity to get water from nearby uncontaminated wells.



---
## The contaminated wells analysis

- In one study, several researchers measured the concentrations of arsenic in wells in a particular region of Bangladesh.

--

- They labeled wells as safe or unsafe based on the measurements.

--

- The researchers encouraged people drinking from unsafe wells to switch to safe wells.

--

- Several years later, the researchers returned to the area with the goal of seeing who had switched from unsafe to safe wells.

--

- They recorded information on a sample of 3020 individuals who had wells at their homes that were unsafe.

--

- Let's address the question: what predicts why people switch wells?

--

- The data is in the file `arsenic.csv` on Sakai.



---
## The contaminated wells analysis

Data description

Variable    | Description
:------------- | :------------
Switch | 1 = if respondent switched to a safe well <br /> 0 = if still using own unsafe well
Arsenic | amount of arsenic in well at respondent's home (100s of micro-grams per liter)
Dist | distance in meters to the nearest known safe well
Assoc | 1 = if any members of household are active in community organizations <br /> 0 = otherwise
Educ | years of schooling of the head of household

Treat switch as the response variable and others as potential explanatory variables



---
## Logistic regression with multiple predictors:

We can then formally extend the .hlight[logistic regression model] we had before to allow for multiple predictors.

We still have
.block[
.small[
$$\Pr[y_i = 1 | x_i]  = \pi_i \ \ \textrm{and} \ \ \Pr[y_i = 0 | x_i] = 1-\pi_i,$$
]
]

or
.block[
.small[
$$y_i | x_i \sim \textrm{Bernoulli}(\pi_i)$$
]
]

as before, but with 
.block[
.small[
$$\textrm{log}\left(\dfrac{\pi_i}{1-\pi_i}\right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i1} + \beta_2 x_{i2} + \ldots + \beta_p x_{ip}$$
]
]

now in both cases.


---
## The contaminated wells analysis: EDA

```{r fig.height=3.4}
arsenic <- read.csv("data/arsenic.csv",header=T,
                    colClasses=c("numeric","numeric","numeric","factor","numeric"))
head(arsenic)
summary(arsenic[,-1])
table(arsenic$switch)
```



---
## The contaminated wells analysis: EDA

```{r fig.height=2.8}

axis(1,at=c(1,2),labels=c("No","Yes"))
```



---
## The contaminated wells analysis: EDA

```{r fig.height=2.8}
par(mfrow=c(1,3))
boxplot(educ~switch,data=arsenic,ylab="Years of schooling of head",pch=25,xaxt='n',
        xlab="Switched to safe well?",col=c("red3","yellow3"),cex = 0.85,main ="All")
axis(1,at=c(1,2),labels=c("No","Yes"))
boxplot(educ~switch,data=arsenic,subset= assoc==1,ylab="Years of schooling of head",
        xlab="Switched to safe well?",col=c("red3","yellow3"),xaxt='n',
        pch = 25, cex = 0.85,main ="Active in community")
axis(1,at=c(1,2),labels=c("No","Yes"))
boxplot(educ~switch,data=arsenic,subset= assoc==0,ylab="Years of schooling of head",
        xlab="Switched to safe well?",col=c("red3","yellow3"),xaxt='n',
        pch = 25, cex = 0.85,main ="Not active in community")
axis(1,at=c(1,2),labels=c("No","Yes"))
```


---
## The contaminated wells analysis: EDA

For *switch* vs *assoc*, let's look at a table.

```{r fig.height=3.4}
table(arsenic[,c("switch","assoc")])/sum(table(arsenic[,c("switch","assoc")]))
```

We can also do a chi-squared test for independence.

```{r fig.height=3.4}
chisq.test(table(arsenic[,c("switch","assoc")]))
```

Not enough evidence to show that *assoc* influences *switch*.


---
## The inverse logit function

The relationship between $\pi_i$ and $x_i$ is defined by the .hlight[inverse logit function]
.block[
.small[
$$
\pi_i  = \dfrac{e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i}}{1 + e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i}}
$$
]
]

<!-- Let's compare this to the original logit function. -->

```{r fig.height=2.6}
curve(invlogit((x)),xlim=c(-5,5),col="blue3")
curve(invlogit((2*x)),xlim=c(-5,5),ylim=c(0,1),col="red3",add=T)
curve(invlogit((0.5*x)),xlim=c(-5,5),ylim=c(0,1),col="yellow3",add=T)
curve(invlogit((-x)),xlim=c(-5,5),ylim=c(0,1),col="green3",add=T)
```

Notice the symmetry at the ends.


---
## The contaminated wells analysis: EDA

.hlight[Binned plots] are also quite informative when visualizing binary responses vs continuous predictors. First *switch* vs *arsenic*.

```{r fig.height=2.8}
binnedplot(y=arsenic$switch,arsenic$arsenic,xlab="Arsenic",ylim=c(0,1),col.pts="navy",
           ylab ="Switched to safe well?",main="Binned Arsenic and Switch cases",col.int="white")
```

Not really an inverse logit curve. We may need to transform *arsenic* or add a higher order term.

---
## The contaminated wells analysis: EDA

Now, *switch* vs *dist*.

```{r fig.height=3.3}
binnedplot(y=arsenic$switch,arsenic$dist,xlab="Distance",ylim=c(0,1),col.pts="navy",
           ylab ="Switched to safe well?",main="Binned Distance and Switch cases",col.int="white")
```

Linear relationships are fine and this looks mostly linear. We will re-examine using residual plots.

---
## The contaminated wells analysis: EDA

Next, *switch* vs *educ*.

```{r fig.height=3.3}
binnedplot(y=arsenic$switch,arsenic$educ,xlab="Education",ylim=c(0,1),col.pts="navy",
           ylab ="Switched to safe well?",main="Binned Education and Switch cases",col.int="white")
```

This also looks fine, although, we might consider collapsing some levels of education.

---
## The contaminated wells analysis

Now let's try a logistic regression that has a main effect for every variable and linear predictors. Let's center the continuous predictors.

```{r fig.height=3.3}
arsenic$arsenic_c = arsenic$arsenic - mean(arsenic$arsenic)
arsenic$dist_c = arsenic$dist - mean(arsenic$dist)
arsreg1 <- glm(switch~arsenic_c+dist_c+assoc+educ,data=arsenic,family=binomial); summary(arsreg1)
```


---
## The contaminated wells analysis

Let's do some model assessment

```{r fig.height=3,message=F}
binnedplot(fitted(arsreg1),residuals(arsreg1,"resp"),xlab="Pred. probabilities",
           col.int="red4",ylab="Avg. residuals",main="Binned residual plot",col.pts="navy")
```


--
<div class="question">
What do you think?
</div>

Looks like the residuals are well spread out, with no obvious trend.


---
## The contaminated wells analysis

Plot binned raw residuals versus individual predictors.

```{r fig.height=3,message=F}
binnedplot(arsenic$arsenic_c,residuals(arsreg1,"resp"),xlab="Arsenic centered",
           col.int="red4",ylab="Avg. residuals",main="Binned residual plot",col.pts="navy")
```

--
<div class="question">
What do you think?
</div>

Not good! There's a pattern here we need to account for!


---
## The contaminated wells analysis

```{r fig.height=3,message=F}
binnedplot(arsenic$dist_c,residuals(arsreg1,"resp"),xlab="Distance centered",
           col.int="red4",ylab="Avg. residuals",main="Binned residual plot",col.pts="navy")
```


--
<div class="question">
What do you think?
</div>

There are too many observations outside the SD lines, but not much else to worry about.


---
## The contaminated wells analysis

```{r fig.height=3,message=F}
binnedplot(arsenic$educ,residuals(arsreg1,"resp"),xlab="Education",
           col.int="red4",ylab="Avg. residuals",main="Binned residual plot",col.pts="navy")
```


--
<div class="question">
What do you think?
</div>

Looks like there might be different trends for different sections of education. Maybe we should collapse the levels?


---
## The contaminated wells analysis

```{r fig.height=3,message=F}
Conf_mat <- confusionMatrix(as.factor(ifelse(fitted(arsreg1) >= 0.5, "1","0")),
                            as.factor(arsenic$switch),positive = "1")
Conf_mat$table
Conf_mat$overall["Accuracy"];
Conf_mat$byClass[c("Sensitivity","Specificity")]
```

.hlight[confusionMatrix] produces a lot of output. Print the .hlight[Conf_mat] object to see all of them.

Clearly, we can calculate these out-of-sample as well, which can be useful. For out-of-sample, you should replace .hlight[fitted(arsreg1)] with .hlight[predict(arsreg1,newdata,type="response)].



---
## The contaminated wells analysis


```{r fig.height=4,message=F}
invisible(roc(arsenic$switch,fitted(arsreg1),plot=T,print.thres="best",legacy.axes=T,
              print.auc =T,col="red3"))
```
 
We can also do this for out-of-sample predictions.


---
## Change in deviance statistic

- Suppose we want to test whether a particular subset of $q$ of the coefficients are zero. That is,
.block[
.small[
$$
\begin{split}
H_0 & : \beta_{p-q+1} = \beta_{p-q+2} = \ldots = \beta_p = 0\\
H_A & : \textrm{At least one } \beta_{j} \neq 0; \textrm{ where } j = p-q+1, \ldots, p.
\end{split}
$$
]
]

- In linear regression we use the nested F-test to compare two nested models.

- In logistic regression we use the .hlight[change in deviance test].

- Expression for change in deviance on next slide for those interested, but formula not essential for our course.

- Can use the anova command in R! Hooray!!


---
## Change in deviance statistic

- Let $y_i = 1$ when the outcome variable for record $i$ equals 1, and $y_i = 0$ when the outcome variable for record $i$ equals 0.

- Let $\hat{\pi}_{1i}$ and $\hat{\pi}_{2i}$ be the be the estimated probabilities that $y_i = 1$ for Model 1 and Model 2, respectively, where Model 1 is nested within Model 2. 

- For a logistic regression, the change in deviance test statistic is defined as:
.block[
.small[
$$D = 2 \left(\sum_{i=1}^n \left[y_i \textrm{log}(\hat{\pi}_{1i}) + (1-y_i) \textrm{log}(1-\hat{\pi}_{1i})\right] - \sum_{i=1}^n \left[y_i \textrm{log}(\hat{\pi}_{2i}) + (1-y_i) \textrm{log}(1-\hat{\pi}_{2i})\right] \right)$$
]
]

- In large samples, $D$ has approximately a chi-squared distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the difference in the number of predictors in Model 1 and Model 2.


---
## The contaminated wells analysis

Suppose we want to test the interaction between *arsenic* and *assoc*.

```{r fig.height=3.3}
arsreg2 <- glm(switch~arsenic_c+dist_c+assoc+educ+arsenic_c:assoc,data=arsenic,family=binomial)
anova(arsreg1, arsreg2, test= "Chisq")
AIC(arsreg1); AIC(arsreg2)
```

At the 0.05 level, we can conclude that the interaction term is not significant, confirming our EDA. The AIC values also confirms that.




---
## The contaminated wells analysis

Let's compare ROC curves and AUC values for the two models.

```{r fig.height=4,message=F}
invisible(roc(arsenic$switch,fitted(arsreg1),plot=T,print.thres="best",legacy.axes=T,
              print.auc =T,col="red1"))
invisible(roc(arsenic$switch,fitted(arsreg2),plot=T,print.thres="best",legacy.axes=T,
              print.auc =T,col="blue4",add=T))
```



---
## The contaminated wells analysis

```{r fig.height=3,message=F}
Conf_mat <- confusionMatrix(as.factor(ifelse(fitted(arsreg1) >= 0.5, "1","0")),
                            as.factor(arsenic$switch),positive = "1")
Conf_mat$overall["Accuracy"]; Conf_mat$byClass[c("Sensitivity","Specificity")]
Conf_mat2 <- confusionMatrix(as.factor(ifelse(fitted(arsreg2) >= 0.5, "1","0")),
                            as.factor(arsenic$switch),positive = "1")
Conf_mat2$overall["Accuracy"]; Conf_mat2$byClass[c("Sensitivity","Specificity")]
```

These results again confirm our EDA and the test.

We still need to take a step back and fix the relationship with arsenic. We will do so in the next class and build our final model a bit more carefully.
