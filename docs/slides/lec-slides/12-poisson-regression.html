# Probit regression


---
## Probit regression

- Recall the .hlight[logistic regression model]:
.block[
.small[
`$$y_i | x_i \sim \textrm{Bernoulli}(\pi_i); \ \ \ \textrm{log}\left(\dfrac{\pi_i}{1-\pi_i}\right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i1} + \beta_2 x_{i2} + \ldots + \beta_p x_{ip}; \ \ \ i=1,\ldots,n.$$`
]
]

--

- Here the link function is the .hlight[logit function], which ensures that the probabilities lie between 0 and 1.

--

- We can also use the .hlight[probit function] `\(\Phi^{-1}\)`, which is the quantile function associated with the standard normal distribution `\(N(0,1)\)`, as the link.

--

- That is, suppose `\(Z\)` is a random variable where `\(Z \sim N(0,1)\)`, then `\(\Phi\)` is the CDF, that is, `\(\Pr[Z \leq z] = \Phi(z)\)`.

--

- Formally, the .hlight[probit regression model] can be written as
.block[
.small[
`$$y_i | x_i \sim \textrm{Bernoulli}(\pi_i); \ \ \ \Phi^{-1}\left(\pi_i\right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i1} + \beta_2 x_{i2} + \ldots + \beta_p x_{ip}; \ \ \ i=1,\ldots,n.$$`
]
]

--

- It is easy to see that
.block[
.small[
`$$\Pr[y_i = 1 | x_i] = \pi_i = \Phi\left(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i1} + \beta_2 x_{i2} + \ldots + \beta_p x_{ip}\right).$$`
]
]


---
## Probit regression: latent variable representation

- It turns out that we can rewrite the .hlight[probit regression model] as
.block[
.small[
$$
`\begin{split}
y_i &amp; = \mathbb{1}[z_i &gt; 0];\\
z_i &amp; = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i1} + \beta_2 x_{i2} + \ldots + \beta_p x_{ip} + \epsilon_i; \ \ \ \epsilon_i  \sim N(0,1) \\
\end{split}`
$$
]
]

  where `\(y_i = \mathbb{1}[z_i &gt; 0]\)` means `\(y_i = 1\)` if `\(z_i &gt; 0\)` and `\(y_i = 0\)` if `\(z_i &lt; 0\)`.

--
  
- To see that the two representations are equivalent, note that
.block[
.small[
$$
`\begin{split}
\Pr[y_i = 1 | x_i] &amp; = \Pr[z_i &gt; 0] \\
 &amp; = \Pr[\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i1} + \beta_2 x_{i2} + \ldots + \beta_p x_{ip} + \epsilon_i &gt; 0] \\
 &amp; = \Pr[\epsilon_i  &gt; -(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i1} + \beta_2 x_{i2} + \ldots + \beta_p x_{ip})] \\
 &amp; = \Pr[\epsilon_i  &lt; (\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i1} + \beta_2 x_{i2} + \ldots + \beta_p x_{ip})] \ \ \ [\textrm{since} \ \ \ \epsilon_i  \sim N(0,1)] \\
 &amp; = \Phi\left(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i1} + \beta_2 x_{i2} + \ldots + \beta_p x_{ip}\right) = \pi_i
\end{split}`
$$
]
]

--

&lt;!-- - This means, `\(y_i\)` is more likely to be equal to 1 when `\(z_i &gt; 0\)` and more likely to be 0 when `\(z_i &lt; 0\)`. --&gt;

- Clearly, we do not observe `\(Z = (z_1, z_2, \ldots, z_n)\)` and it is thus referred to as an .hlight[auxiliary variable].


---
## Probit vs logit functions?

- The plots below compare the inverse logit function `\(\pi_i  = \dfrac{e^{x}}{1 + e^{x}}\)` and the CDF function (inverse probit) `\(\pi_i = \Phi(x)\)`.

&lt;img src="12-poisson-regression_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Notice that they are similar, but the CDF of the standard normal distribution has fatter tails (the inverse logit has thinner tails).

---
## Probit or logistic regression?

- In practice, the decision to use one or the other is often based on preference: the overall conclusions from both are usually quite similar.

--

- The results based on logistic regression (using odds and odds ratio) can be more interpretable than those based on Probit regression.

--

- In some applications, interpreting the  `\(z_i\)`'s may be meaningful but that is not always the case.

--

- For example, suppose `\(y_i\)` is a binary variable for whether or not person `\(i\)` chooses to buy the new iPhone, then `\(z_i\)` can be thought of as person `\(i\)`'s "utility" in a way.

--

- In .hlight[R], use the `glm` command but set the option `family="binomial(link=probit)` instead of `family="binomial(link=logit)`.

# Poisson regression



---
## Count data

- Suppose you have count data (non-negative integers) as your response variable. 

--

- For example, we may want to explain the number of c-sections carried out in hospitals using potential predictors such as
  + hospital type, that is, private vs public
  + location
  + size of the hospital

--

- The models we have covered so far are not adequate for count data.

--

- While this is generally the case, there are instances where linear regression, with some transformations (especially taking logs) on the response variable, might still work reasonably well for count data.

--

- Thus, one can attempt to fit a linear regression model first, check to see if the assumptions of the model are violated, and then move on to a more appropriate model if needed.


---
## Poisson regression

- A good distribution for modeling count data with no limit on the total number of counts is the .hlight[Poisson distribution].

--

- &lt;div class="question"&gt;
What would the Binomial distribution be inappropriate when there is no limit on the total number of counts?
&lt;/div&gt;

--

- The Poisson distribution is parameterized by `\(\lambda\)` and the pmf is given by
.block[
.small[
`$$\Pr[Y = y] = \dfrac{\lambda^y e^{-\lambda}}{y!}; \ \ \ \ y=0,1,2,\ldots; \ \ \ \ \lambda &gt; 0.$$`
]
]

--

- An interesting feature of the Poisson distribution is.
.block[
.small[
`$$\mathbb{E}[Y = y] = \mathbb{V}[Y = y] = \lambda.$$`
]
]


--

- When our data fails this assumption, we may have what is known as .hlight[over-dispersion] and may want to consider the [Negative Binomial distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_binomial_distribution) instead, or try a Bayesian specification (STA602!).

--

- With no predictors, the best guess for `\(\lambda\)` is the sample mean, that is, `\(\hat{\lambda} = \sum_{i=1}^n \dfrac{y_i}{n}\)`.
  


---
## Poisson regression

- With predictors, we want to index `\(\lambda\)` with `\(i\)`, where each `\(\lambda_i\)` is a function of `\(\boldsymbol{X}\)`. We can therefore write the .hlight[random component] of this glm as
.block[
.small[
$$y_i \sim \textrm{Poisson}(\lambda_i); \ \ \ i=1,\ldots,n. $$
]
]

--

- We must ensure that `\(\lambda_i &gt; 0\)` at any value of `\(\boldsymbol{X}\)`, therefore, we need a .hlight[link function] that enforces this. A natural choice is the natural logarithm, so that we have
.block[
.small[
`$$\textrm{log}\left(\lambda_i\right) = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} x_{i1} + \beta_{2} x_{i2} + \ldots + \beta_{p} x_{ip}.$$`
]
]

--

- Combining these pieces give us our full mathematical representation for the .hlight[Poisson regression].

--

- In .hlight[R], use the `glm` command but set the option `family = “poisson”`.

--

- Clearly, `\(\lambda_i\)` has a natural interpretation as the "expected count", and
.block[
.small[
`$$\lambda_i = e^{\beta_{0} + \beta_{1} x_{i1} + \beta_{2} x_{i2} + \ldots + \beta_{p} x_{ip}}$$`
]
]

  means that we can interpret the `\(e^{\beta_{j}}\)`'s as .hlight[multiplicative effects] on the expected counts.


---
## Poisson regression

- For predictions, we can look at the expected counts, that is,
.block[
.small[
`$$\hat{\lambda}_i = e^{\hat{\beta_{0}} + \hat{\beta_{1}} x_{i1} + \hat{\beta_{2}} x_{i2} + \ldots + \hat{\beta_{p}} x_{ip}}$$`
]
]

--

- Interpretation of `\(e^{\beta_j}\)`:
  + For continuous `\(x_j\)`: the expected count of `\(Y\)` increases by a multiplicative factor of `\(e^{\beta_j}\)` when increasing `\(x_j\)` by one unit.
  + For binary `\(x_j\)`: the expected count of `\(Y\)` increases by a multiplicative factor of `\(e^{\beta_j}\)` for the group with `\(x_j = 1\)` in comparison to the group with `\(x_j = 0\)`.
 
--
 
- For example, suppose
  + Suppose the response variable is the number of mating for elephants, and let `\(x_1\)` represent the age of the elephants
  + Also suppose `\(\hat{\beta}_j = 0.069\)`, so that `\(e^{\hat{\beta}_j} = e^{0.069} = 1.0714\)`.
  + Then, an increase in age of one year increases the expected number of mating for elephants by 7 percent.
  
  
---
## Poisson regression

- The raw residuals `\(e_i = y_i - \hat{\lambda}_i\)` are difficult to interpret since variance is equal to the mean in Poisson distributions.

--

- Use the Pearson's residuals instead:
.block[
.small[
`$$r_i = \dfrac{y_i - \hat{\lambda}_i}{\sqrt{\hat{\lambda}_i}}$$`
]
]

--

- Plot the `\(r_i\)`'s versus the predicted `\(\hat{\lambda}_i\)`'s, as well as the  `\(x_j\)` values for each predictor `\(j\)`, to look for trends suggesting model misspecification.

--

- We can also use those to identify potential outliers.

--

- We can still check for multicollinearity, do model validation using RMSE, and do model selection via forward, backward and stepwise selection for Poisson regression.

--

- We can also perform a change in deviance test to compare nested models.

## Springbok analysis

The data contains counts of springbok antelope around 25 watering holes.

&lt;img src="img/springbok2.jpg" height="400px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

The data is in the file `springbok.csv` on Sakai.



---
## Springbok analysis

- Springbok are counted at each site (hole) at an altitude of 200-300 meters.

--

- A survey normally includes counts at all 25 sites but occasionally some sites could not be counted because of poor weather.

--

- For larger groups of springbok, color photographs were taken and springbok were counted later from the photos. 

--

- Several surveys, usually 7-10, were made each year. 

--

- Within a year, springbok are faithful to a single site. That is, if a springbok goes to site `\(i\)` on one day, it will return to site `\(i\)` on other days.

--

- We want to
  + Analyze trend
  + Estimate the effects of predictors
  
  

---
## Springbok analysis data

- n = 1050 counts from 1990-2002 for sites 12-21, 23, and 24. 

-  The other sites were excluded because they usually don't have many antelope. 

- Three time variables: year, date (week) and hour from noon.

Variable    | Description
:------------- | :------------
LOCNUMBER | Location Number 
SITEI | Site
YEAR | Year (1990 - 2002) 
DATE | Week (14 - 42)
HourFromNoon | Hour From Noon (Numeric)
COUNTS | Springbok Count (Discrete)
