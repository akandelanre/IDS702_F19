# Hierarchical models


---
## Clustered or grouped data

- Often data are grouped or clustered, for example 
  + students within schools,
  + patients within hospitals,
  + voters within counties or states, or
  + repeated measurements on same person, as is often the case in longitudinal studies.
  
- For such clustered data, we may want to infer or estimate the relationship between a response variable and certain predictors collected across all the groups.

- Ideally, we should do so in a way that takes advantage of the relationship between observations in the same group, but we should also look to borrow information across groups.

- .hlight[Hierarchical or multilevel models] provide a principled way to do so. We'll start with simpler cases to elucidate the main ideas.

## Hypothetical school testing example

- Suppose we wish to estimate the distribution of test scores for students at `\(J\)` different high schools.

- In each school `\(j\)`, where `\(j = 1, \ldots, J\)`, suppose we test a random sample of `\(n_j\)` students.

- Let `\(y_{ij}\)` be the test score for the `\(i\)`th student in school `\(j\)`, with `\(i = 1,\ldots, n_j\)`.

- .hlight[Option I]: estimation can be done separately in each group, where we assume
.block[
.small[
`$$y_{ij} | \mu_j, \sigma^2_j \sim N \left( \mu_j, \sigma^2_j\right)$$`
]
]

  where for each school `\(j\)`, let `\(\mu_j\)` be the school-wide average test score, and `\(\sigma^2_j\)` be the school-wide variance of individual test scores.


---
## Hypothetical school testing example

- We can then do classical inference for each school based on large sample 95% CI: `\(\bar{y}_j \pm 1.96 \sqrt{s^2_j/n_j}\)`, where `\(\bar{y}_j\)` is the sample average in school `\(j\)`, and `\(s^2_j\)` is the sample variance in school `\(j\)`.

- Clearly, we can overfit the data within schools, for example, what if we only have 4 students from one of the schools?

- .hlight[Option II]: alternatively, we might believe that `\(\mu_j = \mu\)` for all `\(j\)`; that is, all schools have the same mean. This is the assumption (null hypothesis) in ANOVA models for example.

- Option I ignores that the `\(\mu_j\)`'s should be reasonably similar, whereas option II ignores any differences between them.

- It would be nice to find a compromise! This is what we are able to do with .hlight[hierarchical modeling].

## Hierarchical model

- Instead, we can assume that the `\(\mu_j\)`'s are drawn from a distribution based on the following: conceive of the schools themselves as being a random sample from all possible school.

- Suppose `\(\mu_0\)` is the overall mean of all school's average scores (a mean of the means), and `\(\tau^2\)` is the variance of all school's average scores (a variance of the means).

- Then, we can think of each `\(\mu_j\)` as being drawn from a distribution, for example,
.block[
.small[
`$$\mu_j | \mu_0, \tau^2 \sim N \left( \mu_0, \tau^2 \right),$$`
]
]

  which gives us one more level, resulting in a heirarchical specification.

- We have to estimate `\(\sigma^2_j\)`, `\(\mu_0\)`, and `\(\tau^2\)`, but let's pretend those are fixed for now (use maximum likelihood or Bayesian methods from STA 601/602).

- In this course, we will only scratch the surface of hierarchical modeling. If you want to explore hierarchical models in much more detail, consider taking STA 610.

## Hierarchical model: school testing example

- Back to our example, it turns out that:
.block[
.small[
`$$\hat{\mu}_j \approx \dfrac{ \dfrac{n_j}{\sigma^2_j} \bar{y}_j + \dfrac{1}{\tau^2} \mu_0 }{ \dfrac{n_j}{\sigma^2_j} + \dfrac{1}{\tau^2}  }.$$`
]
]

- .hlight[For those interested in Bayesian inference] (feel free to skip this if you are not!), it turns out that the posterior distribution of `\(\mu_j\)`, `\(p(\mu_j | Y, \sigma^2_j, \mu_0, \tau^2) = N(\mu_j^\star, \nu_j^\star)\)`, where 
.block[
.small[
$$
`\begin{split}
\mu_j^\star &amp; = \dfrac{ \dfrac{n_j}{\sigma^2_j} \bar{y}_j + \dfrac{1}{\tau^2} \mu_0 }{ \dfrac{n_j}{\sigma^2_j} + \dfrac{1}{\tau^2}  } \\
\nu_j^\star &amp; = \dfrac{1}{ \dfrac{n_j}{\sigma^2_j} + \dfrac{1}{\tau^2}  }
\end{split}`
$$
]
]



---
## Hierarchical model: implications

- Our estimate for each `\(\mu_j\)` is a weighted average of `\(\bar{y}_j\)` and `\(\mu_0\)`, ensuring that we are borrowing information across all levels through `\(\mu_0\)` and `\(\tau^2\)`.

- The weights for the weighted average is determined by relative precisions (the inverse of variance is often referred to as precision) from the data and from the second level model.
  
- Suppose all `\(\sigma^2_j \approx \sigma^2\)`. Then the schools with smaller `\(n_j\)` have estimated `\(\mu_j\)` closer to `\(\mu_0\)` than schools with larger `\(n_j\)`.

- Thus, the hierarchical model shrinks estimates with high variance towards the grand mean.

## Mercury in largemouth bass

- High levels of mercury in fish is known to cause health problems, especially in children. 

- We will use data from the Nicholas School of the Environment's study of mercury concentrations in largemouth bass from the Waccamaw and Lumber rivers in NC. A few details about the data:

  + Mercury cannot be excreted and accumulates in tissue over the lifetime of a fish
  + Direct measurement of mercury requires sacrificing fish
  + Potential predictors include easy-to-measure variables such as weight and/or length
  + Fish were caught, weighed and measured at 16 stations
  + Filets sent to the lab for mercury measurements

  &lt;div class="question"&gt;
Can we predict mercury levels for fish caught in these rivers?
&lt;/div&gt;
