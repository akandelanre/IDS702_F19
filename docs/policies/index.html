<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<p>Students are expected to know all topics covered in the MIDS summer course review and boot camp. These include basic probability (including conditional probability, expectations and common probability distributions), and statistical inference (including hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, linear regression with one predictor, and exploratory data analysis). Students are also expected to be familiar with R/Rstudio. Due to space constraints, the course is open only to students in the MIDS program.</p>

<h3 id="class">Class</h3>

<p>Class time is designed to be as interactive as possible. My role as instructor is to introduce you new tools and techniques, but it is up to you to take them and make use of them. The statistical techniques we will cover are best learned by practical data analysis, so you will be working on various datasets as much as possible, through a variety of tasks and activities throughout each class. Ask as many questions as possible during and outside classes; there are no stupid questions.</p>

<h3 id="graded-work">Graded Work</h3>

<p>Graded work for the course will consist of methods and data analysis assignments, team projects, and a final project.</p>

<p>There are no make-ups for assignments or the projects except for medical or familial emergencies or for reasons approved by the instructor before the due date. See the instructor in advance of relevant due dates to discuss possible alternatives.</p>

<p>Grades may be curved at the end of the semester. Cumulative averages of 90% -- 100% are guaranteed at least an A-, 80% -- 89% at least a B-, and 70% -- 79% at least a C-, however the exact ranges for letter grades will be determined at the end of the course.</p>

<h3 id="descriptions-of-graded-work">Descriptions of graded work</h3>

<h4 id="methods-and-data-analysis-assignments">Methods and Data Analysis Assignments</h4>

<p>Methods and data analysis assignments are posted on the course website. Students turn in these assignments on due dates that will be specified on an assignment to assignment basis. Students are permitted to work with others on the assignments, but each person must write up and turn in her or his own answers. The assignments include questions on the computational and the mathematical aspects of the methods that underpin the statistical models we learn during the semester, and questions that ask students to apply the modeling skills discussed during the semester. The assignments must be typed up using R Markdown, LaTeX or another word processor, and submitted on <a href="https://www.gradescope.com/courses/57701/assignments">Gradescope</a> under Assignments. Note that you will not be able to make online submissions after the due date, so be sure to submit before or by the Gradescope-specified deadline.</p>

<h4 id="lab-assignments">Lab Assignments</h4>

<p>The objective of the lab assignments is to give you more hands-on experience with data analysis using R. The labs times also gives you an additional platform to ask for help for your team and individual projects. Lab attendance is not mandatory on days when team presentations will not hold, however, each lab assignment should be submitted in timely fashion on the due date. You are REQUIRED to use R Markdown to type up your lab reports.</p>

<h4 id="team-projects">Team Projects</h4>

<p>For the team projects, students work in teams to analyze data selected by the instructor. Students write a report with their data analysis findings. Students will have the opportunity to present their results in class. Detailed instructions will be made available later.</p>

<h4 id="final-project">Final Project</h4>

<p>For the final project, students analyze a data-based research question of their choosing, subject to the instructor's approval. The data should comprise several variables amenable to statistical analyses via modeling. Students can bring in their own research data sets, or they can ask the instructor for assistance with identifying appropriate data. Students present their results in a class at the end of the semester. Detailed instructions will be made available later.</p>

<h3 id="late-submission-policy">Late Submission Policy</h3>

<ul>
<li>You will lose 50% of the total points on each homework if you submit within the first 24 hours after it is due, and 100% of the total points if you submit later than that.</li>
<li>You will lose 40% of the total points on each lab if you submit within the first 24 hours after it is due, and 100% of the total points if you submit later than that.</li>
