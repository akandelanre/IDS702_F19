<p>Students are expected to know all topics covered in the MIDS summer course review and boot camp. These include basic statistical inference including hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, linear regression with one predictor, and exploratory data analysis methods. Students are also expected to be familiar with R/Rstudio. Due to space constraints, the course is open only to students in the MIDS program.</p>

<h3 id="class">Class</h3>

<p>Class time is designed to be as interactive as possible. My role as instructor is to introduce you new tools and techniques, but it is up to you to take them and make use of them. The statistical techniques we will cover are best learned by practical data analysis, so as much as possible you will be working on various datasets through a variety of tasks and activities throughout each class.</p>

<h3 id="graded-work">Graded Work</h3>

<p>Graded work for the course will consist of methods and data analysis assignments, team projects, and a final project.</p>

<p>There are no make-ups for assignments or the projects except for medical or familial emergencies or for reasons approved by the instructor before the due date. See the instructor in advance of relevant due dates to discuss possible alternatives.</p>

<p>Grades may be curved at the end of the semester. Cumulative averages of 90% -- 100% are guaranteed at least an A-, 80% -- 89% at least a B-, and 70% -- 79% at least a C-, however the exact ranges for letter grades will be determined after the final exam.</p>

<h3 id="descriptions-of-graded-work">Descriptions of graded work</h3>

<h4 id="methods-and-data-analysis-assignments">Methods and Data Analysis Assignments</h4>

<p>Methods and Data Analysis assignments are posted on the IDS 702 course website. Students turn in these assignments at the beginning of class on the due date. Students are permitted to work with others on the assignments, but each person must write up and turn in her or his own answers. The Methods and Data Analysis assignments include questions on the computational and the mathematical aspects of the methods that underpin the statistical models we learn during the semester, and questions that ask students to apply the modeling skills discussed during the semester. Assignments should be turned in using a typesetting system such as LaTeX or R Markdown.</p>

<h4 id="lab-assignments">Lab Assignments</h4>

<p>The objective of the labs is to give you hands on experience with data analysis using modern statistical software. The labs will also provide you with tools that you will need to complete the project successfully. All team members are expected to contribute equally to the completion of each assignment and you will be asked to evaluate your team members after a few assignments are due.</p>

<h4 id="team-projects">Team Projects</h4>

<p>For the team projects, students work in teams to analyze data selected by the instructor. Students write a report with their data analysis findings. Students may have the opportunity to present their results in class. Detailed instructions will be made available on the website.</p>

<h4 id="final-project">Final Project</h4>

<p>For the final project, students analyze a data-based research question of their choosing, subject to the instructor's approval. The data should comprise several variables amenable to statistical analyses via modeling. Students can bring in their own research data sets, or they can ask the instructor for assistance with identifying appropriate data. Students present their results in a poster session. Detailed instructions are available on the Sakai site.</p>

<h3 id="diversity--inclusiveness">Diversity &amp; Inclusiveness:</h3>

<p>It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students' learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I would like to create a learning environment for my students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities (including gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture.) To help accomplish this:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those that appear in your official Duke records, please let me know!</li>
<li>If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don't hesitate to come and talk with me. I want to be a resource for you. If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, your academic dean is an excellent resource.</li>
<li>I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="academic-integrity">Academic integrity:</h3>

<p>Duke University is a community dedicated to scholarship, leadership, and service and to the principles of honesty, fairness, respect, and accountability. Citizens of this community commit to reflect upon and uphold these principles in all academic and nonacademic endeavors, and to protect and promote a culture of integrity.</p>

<p>Remember the Duke Community Standard that you have agreed to abide by:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To uphold the Duke Community Standard:</p>

<ul>
<li>I will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;</li>
<li>I will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors; and</li>
<li>I will act if the Standard is compromised.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Cheating on exams or plagiarism on homework assignments, lying about an illness or absence and other forms of academic dishonesty are a breach of trust with classmates and faculty, violate the <a href="http://www.studentaffairs.duke.edu/conduct/resources/dcs">Duke Community Standard</a>, and will not be tolerated. Such incidences will result in a 0 grade for all parties involved.  Additionally, there may be penalties to your final class grade along with being reported to the <a href="http://www.studentaffairs.duke.edu/conduct/about/ucbhearings">Undergraduate Conduct Board</a>.</p>

<p>Please review the Academic Dishonesty policies <a href="https://studentaffairs.duke.edu/conduct">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="disability-statement">Disability Statement</h3>

<p>Students with disabilities who believe that they may need accommodations in the class are encouraged to contact the <a href="https://access.duke.edu/students/staff.php">Student Disabilities Access Office</a> at 919-668-1267 or <a href="mailto:disabilities@aas.duke.edu">disabilities@aas.duke.edu</a> as soon as possible to better ensure that such accommodations are implemented in a timely fashion.</p>

<h3 id="other-information">Other Information</h3>

<p>It can be a lot more pleasant oftentimes to get in-person answers and help. Make use of the teaching team's office hours, we're here to help! Do not hesitate to come to my office during office hours or by appointment to discuss a homework problem or any aspect of the course.  Questions related to course assignments and honesty policy should be directed to me. When the teaching team has announcements for you we will send an email to your Duke email address. Please make sure to check your email daily.</p>

<h3 id="professionalism">Professionalism</h3>
