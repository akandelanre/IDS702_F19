      <description>Prerequisites Students are expected to know all topics covered in the MIDS summer course review and boot camp. These include basic probability (including conditional probability, expectations and common probability distributions), and statistical inference (including hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, linear regression with one predictor, and exploratory data analysis). Students are also expected to be familiar with R/Rstudio. Due to space constraints, the course is open only to students in the MIDS program.</description>
