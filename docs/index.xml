      <description>Prerequisites Students are expected to know all topics covered in the MIDS summer course review and boot camp. These include basic statistical inference including hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, linear regression with one predictor, and exploratory data analysis methods. Students are also expected to be familiar with R/Rstudio. Due to space constraints, the course is open only to students in the MIDS program.
Class Class time is designed to be as interactive as possible.</description>
