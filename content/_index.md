### Course Overview
Statistical models are necessary for analyzing the type of multivariate (often large) datasets that are usually encountered in data science and statistical science. This is a graduate level course, within the curriculum for Duke's Master in Interdisciplinary Data Science (MIDS) program, that aims to provide students with the statistical data analysis tools needed to succeed as data scientists. 

In this course, you will learn the general work flow for building statistical models and using them to answer inferential questions. You will learn several parametric modeling techniques such as generalized linear models, models for multilevel data and time series models. You will also learn to handle messy data, including data with missing or erroneous values, and data with outliers or non-standard distributions. You will be able to assess model fit, validate model assumptions and more generally, check whether proposed statistical models are appropriate for any given data. You will also learn causal inference under the potential outcomes framework. Should time permit, we may also briefly cover nonparametric models such as classification and regression trees. 

Although this course emphasizes data analysis over rigorous mathematical theory, students who wish to explore the mathematical theory in more detail than what is covered in class are welcome to engage with and request further reading materials from the instructor outside of class.


### Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students should be able to

- Use the statistical methods and models covered in class to analyze real multivariate data that intersect with various fields. 
- Assess the adequacy of statistical models to any given data and make a decision on what to do in cases when certain models are not appropriate for a given dataset.
- Cleanup and analyze messy datasets using approaches covered in class.
- Hone collaborative and presentations skills through the process of consistent team work on and class presentations of team projects.
